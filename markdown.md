# ALWAYS BE LEARNING

---

# Always Be Learning
Not knowing something now is never a reason to not know something tomorrow. Don't be lazy, be learning.

---

# Learn how to learn; learn to love learning; learn to apply learning
Any tech tool we teach today is likely going to be obsolete before long. We embrace this and instead use every opportunity teaching a specific thing to instead teach the underlying skills, approach, and foster the passion, purpose, and process of learning itself. If we fail at doing this, nothing else we teach them will help them for very long.

---

# Learn to volunteer, volunteer to learn 
If you don't know how to do something you should volunteer to learn. When an organization needs a thing that often means it hasn't found a way to pay for it. This lack of funding can actually become an opportunity for you as the organization will sometimes take a risk by accepting help from an unproven individual who volunteers with an interest in learning.

---

# Three Before Me
Whenever you have a question, do three things to try to find the answer before asking up.

---

# Experience → Access → Pathways
Start with a sample, join something substantial, and then proceed down a pathway.

---

# DEFAULT TO OPEN

---

# Default to Open; Default to Trust
Many places start you off with a 0 balance of trust and you have to earn trust. Another way to phrase this though is that you start off distrusted. We prefer to take the opposite approach and provide our staff and our youth with a positive balance of trust. This is demonstrated by the tools we let them use, the fact that they have admin rights on their computers and we don't aggressively or preemptively block the Internet.

---

# Read Your Audience
Although it shouldn't change what you say, who you are speaking to should change how you say it.

---

# No One-Word Answers
Questions require more than one word to ask. Answers should take more than one word to respond.

---

# Tone Matters; Don't Talk Down to Anyone Anywhere
Regardless of whether you are talking directly to someone or about them, your tone matters. Believe the best about them and always act as though they could hear what you say and how you are saying it.

---

# Accessibility vs Applicability
Balance what is most available and approachable with what is most useful in real-world situations. Start with accessibility but always move towards applicability.

---

# Planned Flexibility
Build structures that allow for iteration and be willing to change direction at points throughout the process. Don't get stuck in a previous plan.

---

# WORK IS FOR THE WILLING

---

# Work Is For The Willing
For those willing to do what is needed, not just what they want, there will always be (and often an abudance of) work. For those who only want to do certain things in specific ways, there is often a decreasing amount of work to be had.

---

# Youth Focused
The organization was founded to serve youth. Everything we do should be with an eye on how it benefits them. If two things are contradictory, default to the one that is more beneficial to the youth. Said another way, Digital Harbor is not here to serve the staff, the staff are here to serve the youth.

---

# Interested and Happy to Help
When something is needed, the best way to be is interested and happy to help.

---

# We Don't Whine, We Solve Problems
Solving problems without fussing moves you forward faster. Lateral complaining leaves you stuck in it and does far more harm than good.

---

# ALIGN TO THE CLEAR VIEW

---

# Align to the Clear View
A crew team rows facing backwards with one designated to see the course and call the rythm. Align your rowing to the clear view.

---

# Experience Matters, Listen and Learn from It
When facing a decision show as much deference to experience as it takes to learn from it, regardless of the source.

---

# Progress More than Position
Where you are currently is only temporary. Where you are going (in both speed and direction) determines where you will be, and that matters a lot more the longer the time apperature. Expect progress (not perfection) from yourself and others, every day.

---

# Flexible to Improve
In every situation there is room for improvement, be flexible enough to find ways to bend towards it.

---

# Ask Don’t Accuse
If you don't understand something, ask before assuming.

---

# Willing To Have Uncomfortable Conversations
Never let a difficult conversation stop you from making progress.

---

# EFFECTIVE & EFFICIENT

---

# Effective & Efficient 
You need to be both, eventually. But if you can only be one, be effective.

---

# Proportionality
The response to a situation should be in proportion to the causality.

---

# No Place for Hypocrisy
A small dose does a lot of damage. Don't give any room for it.

---

# Change is the Only Constant
Don't get complacent. Don't expect things to stay the same. Don't resist growth.

---

# Not Knowing Is Acceptable, Not Thinking Is Not!
Digital Harbor doesn't expect you to always know everything, but we do expect you to always be thinking.

---

# Empowered Execution
Making decisions throughout the organization without always

---

# Horizontal Collaboration
Divisions help to structure organizations but should never become barriers to collaborations. Seek for ways programs can work together.

---

# Shared Consciousness
Knowing what someone else would do without asking requires empathy, understanding, and an alignment to values.

---

# Structural vs. Temporary
Identify if a stressor is the result of a specific situation or underlying condition. Endure the temporary and fix the forever.

---

# Don't Get Distracted
Focusing on your task at hand requires discipline but is the only way to actually accomplish the task.
